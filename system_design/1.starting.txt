LLD (Low-Level Design) - Core Concepts
=======================================

Three Pillars of LLD:
1. Scalability - Handle growth in users/data
2. Maintainability - Easy to update and fix
3. Reusability - Modular, reusable components

Definition:
LLD = DSA + Real-World Problem Solving

What LLD is NOT:
- Tech stack selection
- Database choice
- Server scaling infrastructure
- Cost optimization
- HLD (High-Level Design) - focuses on system architecture

Key Distinction:
- HLD: System architecture and design
- LLD: Code structure and skeleton for the application
- DSA: The brain/foundation that powers efficient LLD solutions

Example: E-commerce Product Cart
=================================

Problem: Design a shopping cart system

LLD Approach:
1. Define classes: Product, Cart, User
2. Methods: addItem(), removeItem(), calculateTotal()
3. Data structures: Use HashMap for O(1) lookups of products
4. Logic: Apply discounts, validate inventory

Code Skeleton:
```
class Product {
  id, name, price
}

class Cart {
  items: HashMap<productId, quantity>
  
  addItem(product, qty) -> add to HashMap
  removeItem(productId) -> remove from HashMap
  getTotal() -> iterate & sum prices
  applyDiscount(percent) -> modify total
}

class User {
  cart: Cart
  checkout() -> process cart
}
```

Here, DSA (HashMap) ensures efficient operations, and the modular design makes it reusable and maintainable.
