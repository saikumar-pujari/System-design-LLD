in memory data structure used for DB,messgae broker and stream engine mostly used in linux and ansi c is written
mostly used by windows only -->cache.PORT-6973
    codes:-
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install redis
        sudo systemmctl status redis
        sudo systemmctl enable redis
        sudo systemmctl start redis
        sudo systemmctl stop redis
        sudo systemmctl restart redis
        sudo systemmctl restart redis-server
        sudo systemmctl restart redis.service
        redis-cli --version
        
        redis-server
        redis-cli
        redis-cli -h host -p port -a password

        its server works in background and listen for the client connections mainly used for storing and managedign the data in memory.
        redis-cli(command line interface)--used for writing command
        redlisinsight used the redis-cli as GUI

        config get *

        string naming:-
            <entity>:<id> value
            id. name
            1   sai         -->set user:1 sai
            2   sony        -->set user:2 sony  
            3   radhika     -->set user:3 radhika
        (setnx only creates when the values are not present in the server)

        set user:1 sai (auto creates the string and if exists it will update the value)
        setnx user:2 nikhil (first checks the string if not exists it will create and if exists it will noot create)
        mget used for multiple get from ths data(mget user:1 user:2 user:3)
        mset used for multiple sets for the data(mset user:4 nikhil user:5 radha user:6 vaishu)
        incremsnt and decrement--> set count 0; incr count 10(no of incrments defualt is 1)
        for TTL use set expire user:1 10(time in sec)->means the user:1 will expire in 10sec

        list-->used mainly for stacks and queues
        lpush add the value to the left side of the queues and rpush on right side
        lpop and rpop removes the value at the index at lpop or rpop
        blpop and brpop

        del user:* delets everything in user

        sets:-
        sadd,srem,sismember
